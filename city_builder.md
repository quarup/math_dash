## Status

- **Last updated:** 2026-06-14 (Phase-9 catalog completed — all 54 anchors wired + sprite-backed; `train_station` dropped, the rail can't be drawn coherently in 2:1 dimetric)
- **Phase:** Phase 8 — City Builder: Research & Rich Design. Content-authoring only, **no code changes**. Deliverable is this document; Phase 9 implements it.
- **Drafting mode:** *fill pass complete (first draft)*. §1 (references), §2 (categories), §3 (full building specs — 54 anchors), §4 (beat catalog), §5 (asset checklist), and §7 (open questions) are drafted. §6 (implementation status) is auto-managed by [tools/city_builder/sync_implementation_status.py](tools/city_builder/sync_implementation_status.py); as of 2026-06-14 all 54 anchors are wired and sprite-backed. Three structure decisions are locked (2026-05-31): education (`school`/`high_school`) lives under `services`; `water` is a hard-gating service; the housing spine keeps all 7 rungs. **Still expects Phase-9 iteration** — costs and service ratios are designed-coherent placeholders, finalized by playtest.
- **Framework:** extends the Phase-7 model — four categories, the service-ratio + variety-multiplier growth model, and the typed `UnlockRule` / `TriggerRule` gates. **Currency revised 2026-09-08:** the two-currency 🧱/🔬 design this document was drafted against was replaced by a single currency, **coins** (1 coin ≈ 1 expected second of study); §3's cost columns and §3.5 were re-denominated accordingly, and the research step is gone — a building whose unlock rule passes is bought straight away. See prd.md *Cosmetics System*.
- **Scope of this pass:** *representative breadth* — full coherent arcs across all four categories with ~54 anchor buildings individually specced; the long-tail variants (cosmetic re-skins, minor tier infills) are described as patterned templates rather than itemized. This keeps the design coherent and reviewable and gives Phase 9 a clear queue without committing to hundreds of hand-authored rows up front.
- **Source of truth note:** once Phase 9 starts wiring content, the building/beat **IDs here become the source of truth**, mirrored by [building_registry.dart](lib/domain/city/building_registry.dart) and [beat_registry.dart](lib/domain/city/beat_registry.dart) — exactly as `curriculum.md` is mirrored by `generator_registry.dart`.

## 1. References & Lessons Learned

Phase 8 exists so the building DAG *feels infinite without becoming a junk drawer*
(see [plan.md](plan.md) Risks). Before designing, we studied how established
city-builders pace their progression — what makes unlocks feel rewarding, and
what makes them feel like a grind. Findings below, then what Math City borrows
and what it deliberately rejects.

### 1.1 What the reference games do

**SimCity 4 — reward buildings & the RCI feedback loop.**
SC4's headline progression is *unlock-by-need* and *unlock-by-population*: reward
buildings (and whole zone tiers) appear as the city crosses population thresholds
and as mayor rating / demand rises. Underneath sits the **RCI loop** (Residential
/ Commercial / Industrial): residents create demand for jobs, jobs create demand
for residents, and the three must stay *balanced* — a lopsided city stalls or
abandons. Desirability is local (the mayor's house and parks raise the
desirability of nearby tiles). The lesson: a small set of **interdependent
categories whose imbalance the player can feel** produces emergent, legible
progression without a scripted tech tree.

**Cities: Skylines (I & II) — milestone XP pacing.**
Progress is gated by *milestones*; almost every building has upgraded versions
that unlock as the city grows, so the player is "constantly looking forward to
the next milestone." Cities: Skylines II refined this into **Expansion Points**
that accrue two ways: **passively** (steady drip from population + happiness) and
**actively** (bursts from placing/upgrading service buildings, signature
buildings, expanding roads). The stated design goal: let players build the city
they want — *a small, well-run town should still progress* — rather than forcing
everyone toward a high-population end-game. The lesson: **steady passive drip +
active bursts**, and **don't make scale mandatory** to feel progression.

**Anno series — need-driven tier-ups.**
Residents sit in tiers (e.g. Anno 117's Liberti → Plebians → …). Each tier has a
set of **needs** (food, public services, fashion); satisfy them and residents
*upgrade to the next tier*, which unlocks more advanced buildings — which in turn
have their own, higher needs. The main loop *is* need-satisfaction → tier-up →
new needs. Production-chain ratios reward keeping supply matched to demand. The
lesson: **needs surface the next unlock**; progression reads as "the town asked
for X, I provided it, now the town wants Y."

**SimCity BuildIt — the cautionary case.**
Its progression is widely critiqued: the soft-currency economy is so tight that
*leveling up doesn't feel good* — players sometimes deliberately avoid it because
each new tier raises costs faster than rewards. The lesson (a **reject**):
unlocks must feel like a *reward for play*, never a tax that makes the next thing
harder to afford. Artificial scarcity + pay-to-skip timers are exactly the
free-to-play patterns Math City's PRD forbids.

**Township / Stardew Valley — the cozy loop.**
Even "relaxing" games run on a tight, satisfying core loop: venture → gather →
return → **reinvest in a visible upgrade** → repeat. The reward is that the loop
is *short* and the reinvestment is *immediately visible*. The tension worth
naming: cozy aesthetics can still hide a grind. The lesson: keep the
answer→earn→place→see-it-grow loop short and always-positive; no fail states.

### 1.2 What Math City borrows

1. **Need-driven discovery (Anno + SC4 "unlock by need").** The citizen demand
   bubble *is* the need signal. A building's catalog card only appears after the
   player reads the demand beat that asks for it (already true in Phase 7 via
   `requiredBeatsRead`). Phase 8 scales this into **arcs**: satisfying one tier's
   need surfaces the next tier's demand ("the apartments are full — what about a
   high-rise?").
2. **Within-category upgrade arcs (Cities: Skylines).** Every category is a
   legible ladder (housing: single home → duplex → apartment → high-rise → …),
   each rung gated on the previous rung + a population / lifetime-coin threshold.
   The player always has a visible "next rung."
3. **Steady drip + active bursts (CS2 Expansion Points).** Maps onto the coin
   economy for free: coins drip from *every* correct answer (steady, scaled by
   the answer streak); the **band-crossing bonus** arrives in bursts on
   per-concept band-crossings (active). Math practice is the XP source — the
   kid earns progression by *learning*, which is the whole point of the app.
4. **Category-balance feedback (SC4 RCI / Anno ratios).** Already modeled in
   [population_model.dart](lib/domain/city/population_model.dart): service-ratio
   ceilings + a variety multiplier + a lopsidedness penalty. Beats *narrate* the
   imbalance ("trash everywhere!", "all shops and nowhere to live") so the kid
   understands *why* growth stalled and what to build next.
5. **Short, visible, always-positive reinvestment loop (cozy games).** Answer
   math → earn coins → place a building → watch population tick up and a praise
   bubble pop. Keep it short; keep it kind.

### 1.3 What Math City rejects

1. **Tight soft-currency walls / pay-to-skip (SimCity BuildIt).** No
   monetization, no timers, no artificial scarcity. The *only* "cost" of progress
   is math practice. Unlocking must always feel like a reward.
2. **Fail states — bankruptcy, abandonment, RCI collapse (SC4).** Too punishing
   for ages 6–14. Imbalance only ever **slows growth** (a soft population cap) and
   raises a gentle demand bubble; it never destroys what the kid built.
3. **Real-time/energy gating (mobile city-builders).** No "come back in 4 hours."
4. **Deep production chains (Anno).** Too complex for the target age. We abstract
   supply/demand to **service ratios + variety**, not multi-good logistics.
5. **Mandatory high-population end-game (SC4).** Like CS2's stated goal, a kid who
   builds a small cozy town should still feel a full progression arc. Scale is an
   option, not a requirement.

## 2. Categories

Math City keeps the **four** Phase-7 categories (the `BuildingCategory` enum in
[category.dart](lib/domain/city/category.dart)). Each plays a distinct role in
the growth model so that a balanced city outgrows a lopsided one — the RCI lesson,
softened for kids into "slows growth" rather than "collapses."

| Category (`enum`) | Display | Growth role | Variety-counts? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `civicHousing` | Civic & Housing | **The spine.** Housing sets the raw population *ceiling* (`populationContribution`); civic anchors (mayor's office, town hall) are the narrative core and unlock gates. | Mostly no (housing tiers aren't "celebrated for variety") |
| `services` | Services | **The enabler.** Gating infrastructure (power, water, waste, health) lifts the service ceilings so housing can actually fill; soft services (education, safety, transit) add desirability. | Yes |
| `commercial` | Commercial | **The multiplier.** Shops/food/offices raise desirability via the variety bonus and give the town life; over-building them without housing triggers the lopsidedness penalty. | Yes |
| `entertainment` | Entertainment | **The delight.** Parks/culture/recreation are the cozy, praise-heavy channel; they feed the variety multiplier and anchor the happiest beats. | Yes |

**How the categories interact (the growth model, already implemented):**
- **Housing** contributes `populationContribution`; the sum is the raw ceiling.
- **Gating services** (`power`, `clinic`, `waste`, and Phase-8's new `water`) cap
  the population the city can actually support — the thinnest gating service wins,
  each with a small free allowance so a brand-new hamlet isn't pinned at zero.
- **Soft services** (`school`, plus Phase-8 `police`/`fire`/`transit`) are
  *non-gating* amenities — they don't hard-cap growth but feed desirability.
- **Variety** across `services` / `commercial` / `entertainment` adds a capped
  desirability multiplier (livelier mix → denser city).
- **Lopsidedness** (amenities dwarfing housing) applies a desirability penalty.

Phase 8 does **not** change these mechanics — it populates the catalog that feeds
them. New service IDs (`water`, `police`, `fire`, `transit`) are content additions
to the existing `serviceProvision` map and `gatingServiceIds` set, not new
machinery. *(`water` joins the gating set; `police`/`fire`/`transit` are soft.)*

## 3. Building catalog

The full DAG. Each category below is a within-category arc rooted (directly or
indirectly) at `mayors_office`. Tier (Early / Mid / Late / Capstone) is a
narrative pacing label, not a schema field — it maps loosely to the rising
population / lifetime-coin gates in the unlock rule.

**Reading the spec tables.** Columns: **Coins** = `coinCost` (per placement;
one coin ≈ one expected second of study, so the parenthesis is the price in
minutes of math — see prd.md *Cosmetics System*, revised 2026-09-08), **Pop** =
`populationContribution`, **Service** = `serviceProvision` (`id:capacity`), **V** =
`varietyContribution`, **Foot** = `footprint` (`w×h` tiles). The **Unlock rule**
column is the typed `UnlockRule`, written in shorthand:

- `B` (bare building id) → `requiredBuildingsPlaced` includes B
- `pop≥N` → `minPopulation: N`
- `life🪙≥N` → `minLifetimeCoins: N` (lifetime coins = total seconds studied)
- `reads:beat_id` → `requiredBeatsRead` includes that demand beat (the discovery
  gate — the card stays hidden until the player opens that bubble; see §4)

Every non-starter building names exactly one demand beat in `reads:` — that beat
is what reveals its catalog card; once revealed it is bought straight away for its
coin price (there is no separate research/unlock step any more). `✓P7` marks the ten buildings already shipped
in the Phase-7 registry (IDs and Phase-7 numbers preserved).

**Footprint scale.** `1×1` is the base unit — a single house lot. Sizes scale with
how big the real building reads, *not* with how much land we want to spend (land
isn't scarce: the player unlocks more space over time via Phase-9 land expansion,
so footprints aim for *plausibility*, not economy). Guidelines used below:

- **Small shops & utilities** (market stall, coffee shop, bakery, water tower,
  bookshop) — `1×1`–`1×2`.
- **Houses → blocks** grow along the ladder: home `1×1` → duplex `1×2` →
  townhouse row `3×1` (long & thin) → apartment `2×2` → mid-rise `2×3`.
- **Towers stay compact but tall** — `high_rise` / `luxury_condo` / `business_tower`
  / `observation_tower` sit on a `2×2`–`3×3` base; their *scale is conveyed by
  height in the art*, not by sprawling footprint (realistic, and keeps skylines
  legible).
- **Civic & big services** (town/city hall, hospital, school, power station, water
  treatment) — `2×2`–`3×3`.
- **Naturally rectangular things are rectangular** — sports field `3×2`, solar
  farm `4×4` (NB drew the lot square — reconciled 2026-06-12), townhouse row `1×3`.
- **Capstone attractions sprawl** — stadium / shopping mall `4×4`, zoo `5×5`,
  amusement park `6×6`. These are deliberately large "wow" builds that **assume an
  expanded map** (the beginner `12×12` map can't hold a `6×6` park alongside a
  city — see §7 on land expansion / starting map size).
- **Footprint orientation follows the art** (2026-06-12). NB tends to draw a
  rectangular building's long axis toward screen lower-right regardless of the
  prompt, so a `W×H` row is reconciled to the generated sprite at wiring time
  (`duplex`/`post_office` → `2×1`, `town_hall` → `3×2`, `townhouse_row` →
  `1×3`, `aquarium` → `4×3`). Orientation is purely cosmetic — the placement
  engine is orientation-agnostic, and mirroring the art instead would flip its
  shadow direction.

### 3.5 Economy sanity check

*(Re-denominated 2026-09-08 for the single-currency coin economy — coins =
expected seconds of study, so every price reads as minutes of math. These are
first-draft numbers for playtest tuning; the old 🧱 tiers mapped 1:1 onto a
minutes ladder, see the table in the rework PR.)*

- **Coin curve** runs 60–120 (1–2 min; starters) → 300–720 (5–12 min; the
  median building is 600 = 10 min) → 900–1800 (15–30 min; late) → 2400–7200
  (40 min–2 h; landmarks). At full streak a correct answer pays its concept's
  expected seconds (×1.5 on the keypad), so a 600-coin building is ~10 minutes
  of accurate work at any grade — a kindergartner and an 8th grader afford the
  same building after the same study time.
- **Whole catalog once over ≈ 57,700 coins ≈ 16 h of study.** Housing
  repeats (several homes/apartments per city) and land (600 × ring, i.e. 1200
  for the first new block) push the long arc well past that. No artificial
  scarcity (the §1.3 reject) — everything is reachable through normal play.
- **`life🪙` gates** (3600 / 5400 / 7200 / 10800 / 14400 = 1 / 1.5 / 2 / 3 / 4 h
  of lifetime study) read as "you've practiced a lot" milestones. Capstones gate
  on lifetime coins so they feel earned by *total practice*, not just city
  state. Each gate is below the cumulative spend needed to reach it through the
  DAG, so it never binds harder than the prices already do.
- **Research is gone.** The band-crossing coin bonus (2× the concept's expected
  seconds, once per concept per threshold) is the single-currency descendant of
  the old +1 🔬 award — a burst on top of the steady per-answer drip.

### 3.6 Long-tail variants (patterned, not itemized)

Beyond the 54 anchors, the "feels infinite" long tail is generated by *pattern*,
not hand-authored rows:

1. **Cosmetic re-skins** of an existing rung — same stats, different
   `assetRef`/`emoji`, no new unlock logic (e.g. a blue-roof vs red-roof home).
2. **Tier infills** — a new rung slotted between two anchors when play shows a
   pacing gap; just a new `requiredBuildingsPlaced` link, no new mechanic.
3. **Map-themed variants** (countryside / city / futuristic — Phase 9 maps) — the
   same arc re-skinned per theme. The `farmhouse` / `farmers_market` pair is the
   first countryside seed.

**Anchor totals:** 13 civic & housing · 15 services · 13 commercial · 14 entertainment = **55**.

### 3.7 DAG sanity check

- **No cycles.** Every "chains from" points to an earlier or same-tier rung; the
  graph is a forest rooted at `mayors_office` → `single_home`, off which every
  service / commercial / entertainment arc hangs.
- **Multi-parent nodes** are intentional and narratively sensible:
  `shopping_mall` ← (`supermarket` + `clothing_store`); plus soft cross-links that
  read naturally — `library` ← `school`, `bookshop` ← `library`,
  `museum`/`sports_field` ← education/library, `farmers_market` ← `farmhouse`.
  No building depends on an unrelated cross-category prereq.
- **Every building has ≥1 trigger beat** in §4 (the `reads:` demand beat, at
  minimum).

## 4. Story beat catalog

Mirrors §3. Three kinds (Phase-7 `BeatKind`): **demand** (a request — also the
discovery gate via `requiredBeatsRead`), **praise** (placement celebration), and
**warning** (an imbalance the growth model is producing). Tone ∈ silly / civic /
cozy. Each beat below is `id` · tone · emoji `shortLabel` · longText · trigger
summary. Trigger shorthand: `+B` present, `−B` absent, `pop≥N`, `age(B)≥N`
(building age in rounds), `fired:X` (`requiredBeatsFired`), `🪙since≥N`
(`minCoinsEarnedSinceLastBeat`, coins ≈ seconds of study). The exact `TriggerRule` encodes in Phase 9.

> **Authoring convention.** A demand beat fires when its prereq is present and its
> target building is still absent (`+prereq −self`, plus any pop gate matching the
> §3 unlock rule). Once the building is placed it flips to `completed` and clears
> (the Phase-7 demand-completion behavior). Praise beats fire on `+self`.

### 4.3 Warning beats (imbalance the growth model is producing)

These narrate *why growth stalled*. The capacity-pressure cases are encoded as
the `⚠`-marked **demand** beats in §4.1 (each names the upgrade that relieves the
pressure, so the warning *and* the unlock are one bubble). The two genuinely
ratio-driven cases below have no single target building, so they need a small
`TriggerRule` extension (see §7) — drafted here, wired in Phase 9.

| Beat | Tone | Sticker | Text | Trigger (needs §7 extension) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `warn_lopsided` | civic | 🏚️ no homes! | "So many shops and not enough homes — folks love to visit, but nobody can stay! Let's build some housing." | `lopsided` flag (amenities ≫ housing) |
| `warn_growth_stalled` | civic | 🐌 stuck | "The city's stopped growing — something's holding it back. Check your power, water, clinics, and trash." | `population == capacity < housing` |

### 4.4 Recurring & milestone beats

| Beat | Kind | Tone | Text | Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ✅ `demand_more_parks` ✓P7 | demand | cozy | (see §4.1 — re-fires with coin spacing even after a park exists) | `+single_home 🪙since≥600` |
| ✅ `praise_established_town` ✓P7 | praise | civic | "The town's really taking shape — folks are proud to call it home. Nice work, Mayor!" | `+single_home age(mayors_office)≥10 fired:praise_first_home` |
| ✅ `milestone_big_city` | praise | civic | "From a single office to a whole skyline — what an incredible journey, Mayor." | `+high_rise age(mayors_office)≥40 fired:praise_established_town` |

### 4.5 Beat catalog totals

54 demand (one per non-starter building; 5 marked `⚠` are warning-toned
capacity asks) · 15 praise · 2 ratio-warnings · 3 recurring/milestone = **~74
beats** in this first pass. The hundreds-of-beats target is reached in Phase 9 by
adding flavor variants (multiple interchangeable texts per trigger, picked at
random) — a content multiplier on the same trigger set, not new mechanics.

## 5. Asset checklist

Bundled third-party assets must be **CC0, CC-BY, or equivalent —
CC-BY-NC and CC-BY-NC-SA are excluded** (matches [curriculum.md](curriculum.md)
§7 and the licensing rules in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)). Attribution accrues in
[LICENSES_THIRD_PARTY.md](LICENSES_THIRD_PARTY.md). **AI-generated building art
is a separate bucket** — we own the rights to outputs under the generator's
commercial-use terms; any *style-anchor reference images* used to constrain the
generator are still attributed if their source license requires it.

**Per-building need:** one raster sprite, **PNG with transparency**, single
dimetric 2:1 projection, sized to its §3 footprint (`1×1`–`6×6`), with a base
anchor point so the sprite sits on the grid. Phase-7's opaque `assetRef` makes
the emoji-placeholder → sprite swap a resolver change with no domain churn.

### 5.1 Building art pipeline — locked 2026-06-04

**Pipeline: Nano Banana, style-anchored to hand-curated reference images.** A
small set of 2–3 anchor refs (e.g. one home, one tall building, one
cozy/park) — sourced from a CC0 isometric kit so the style influence is
licensing-clean (**Kenney's "Isometric Tiles" series** is the leading anchor
source per the prior-session Kenney research) — is fed on *every* prompt so
palette, line weight, shadow direction, and projection stay coherent across all
54 buildings.

**Scale: 1 tile = 10m × 10m on the ground.** Pinned because a residential
street (6m roadway + 2m sidewalk × 2) is exactly one tile wide, and 10m/tile
sanity-checks across the catalog (a 1×1 `single_home` reads as a 10×10m lot, a
2×2 `apartment` as a 20×20m footprint, etc.). Capstones (`stadium`,
`shopping_mall`, `zoo`, `amusement_park`) are intentionally stylised-small
relative to real-world counterparts so they remain buildable on the player's
grid; their *iconic art cues* (stadium roof, rollercoaster silhouette) carry
the recognition, not square-meterage. The prompt template uses absolute
meters — `"a 20m x 20m footprint"` — to give Nano Banana a consistent scale
reference across the catalog. Height is conveyed by the building's *name*
(`high_rise`, `tower`, `mid_rise`) rather than an explicit meters figure.

**Variants per building.** Generic buildings placed many times (low-rung
housing, parks, coffee shop) ship with multiple sprite variants chosen at
random per placement; unique and rare-late-game buildings ship with one. See
§5.4 for the per-building counts. Phase-9 adds `BuildingType.numVariants` +
`BuildingPlacement.assetVariantIndex` to wire this in.

**Workflow (per building):**
1. Compose the prompt: same anchor refs + per-building noun phrase + tier
   descriptor + "2:1 dimetric, transparent background."
2. Generate 4–6 variants; pick best; light cleanup (trim, base alignment).
3. Side-by-side coherence check every ~10 buildings — drift becomes visible
   quickly; if it has, re-lock the anchors before continuing.
4. Save under `assets/buildings/<building_id>.png`; `building_registry.dart`'s
   `assetRef` points to it. Rendered as Flame sprites (the existing isometric
   renderer already loads tiles by path).

**Hard rules:**
- **No procedural `CustomPainter` art for buildings.** The Phase-7 placeholders
  (colored tile + emoji + label) read as flat / cardboard-y; we won't extend the
  approach to real buildings. *Procedural diagrams for math content
  (`FractionBar`, `Clock`, …) are unaffected — those stay procedural per
  [curriculum.md](curriculum.md).*
- **No mixing finished sprites from different CC0 packs.** Style seams between
  artists are immediately visible to kids and read as amateur.
- **No multi-source generation.** Same anchor refs, same generator, every time.
- **No text on any sprite** — no shop signs, brand names, building lettering,
  street numbers, or other readable characters. Required because the renderer
  flips sprites horizontally per placement to make the building's "front" face
  the nearest road (see §7 *Sprite facing*); mirrored text would read backwards.
  Enforced by appending `"No text."` to every prompt
  ([generate_prompts.py](../tools/sprite_pipeline/generate_prompts.py)).

### 5.2 Alternatives considered (research log)

Recorded so the decision is reviewable and we don't re-litigate it next session.

| Option | Why considered | Why rejected |
|---|---|---|
| **CC0 vector pack as the only source** (Kenney Isometric Vector Buildings) | Vector = beautiful, scales infinitely, CC0, $0 cost. | Covers ~25–30 of the 54 anchors; **missing solar farm, water tower, amusement park, zoo, aquarium, observation tower, recycling** — the late-game capstones the player works toward. Backfilling them by mixing other packs hits the style-seams rule. |
| **Mix multiple CC0 packs** (Kenney + Freepik + OpenGameArt) | Could plug the catalog holes from disparate CC0 sources. | Visible style seams between artists — kids notice and it reads amateur. Hard rule in §5.1. |
| **Procedural `CustomPainter` buildings** (parameterized, mirrors `curriculum.md`'s diagram strategy) | Infinite scaling, no asset pipeline, no licensing surface. | Phase-7 placeholders demonstrated the problem: parameterized shapes look flat next to real sprites. Hard rule in §5.1. |
| **Commission a freelance vector artist** | Best aesthetic ceiling; one consistent hand across the catalog. | ~$1.5–3k indie for the 10-building Phase-7 set; ~$8–20k indie for the full 55 (sources: Whimsy Games, Pixune, 2D Will Never Die — see prior-session research notes). Out of budget for a free hobby project; calendar time (months for 55) also bad. |
| **Recraft V4 Vector** (native SVG GenAI, "Style Lock") | True SVG output; strongest style-consistency feature among native-vector tools; paid plan grants commercial rights. | First-hand evaluation (2026-06-04) unimpressive at the quality bar we want for game art. |
| **Magnific AI Vector** | Also true SVG output. | First-hand evaluation unimpressive (prior session). |
| **Midjourney / SDXL / Flux → Vectorizer.ai trace** | Painterly look possible; Flux + LoRA is the strongest consistency tactic across many assets. | Raster→SVG traces produce thousands of anchor points — heavy, slow to render, painful to clean. Painterly mismatches the chunky-iso aesthetic. |
| **Nano Banana, style-anchored to CC0 refs ← chosen** | Raster output is a native fit for the Flame sprite pipeline (no vector-trace tax). 2026 quality on the iso / clean-geometric end is strong. Anchor-refs-on-every-prompt is the right consistency tactic for 55+ assets. Commercial rights covered by the generator's TOS; reference-style attribution clean via CC0 sources. | Trade-offs: per-building curation cost; coherence drifts and must be re-checked every ~10 buildings; not vector (loses infinite scaling — acceptable since target devices are phones at known DPI ranges). |

### 5.3 Audio

Deferred to Phase 11 per [plan.md](plan.md), listed for completeness: a
building-placed SFX and a bubble-pop SFX cover the whole catalog; capstones may
get a one-off fanfare. Source CC0 from Freesound / OpenGameArt.

### 5.4 Sprite variant counts

**Total: 97 sprites for the 55 anchor buildings.**

Rubric: unique or capstone → 1 · common mid-arc → 2 · frequently placed → 3 ·
highest-volume (low-rung housing, parks, coffee shop) → 4–5. Authoritative copy
of these counts mirrors in
[tools/sprite_pipeline/generate_prompts.py](tools/sprite_pipeline/generate_prompts.py)'s
`VARIANT_COUNTS` dict (the script emits an `Nx` prefix on each generated prompt
from this); keep both in sync when tuning.

### 5.5 Road tiles — decided 2026-06-11; implemented 2026-06-12

Roads are **auto-generated**, not hand-placed: `generateRoads()`
([road_network.dart](lib/domain/city/road_network.dart)) hugs each building
cluster and connects clusters into one network, returning a set of road tiles.
**Implemented (2026-06-12, device-verified):** the tiles render as composited
sprite art — see *Resolution* at the end of this section; the flat grey
diamond fill survives only as the brief async-load fallback.

**The tile set — 7 sprites (5 core + 2 safety).** A road tile connects only to
its **4 orthogonal grid neighbours**, so there are 2⁴ = 16 possible
neighbour masks. The 2:1 dimetric diamond survives **horizontal and vertical
mirroring but *not* 90° rotation** (rotating a 2:1 diamond yields a wrong 1:2),
so the available symmetry group is the flip group `{identity, H, V, 180°}` — not
the full rotate-and-reflect group a square top-down tileset enjoys. Collapsing
the 16 masks under that group yields **7 distinct sprites**:

| Sprite | Connects | Covered by flips | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `road_cross` | 4-way (+) | symmetric (no flip) | core |
| `road_tee` | 3-way (T) | 1 sprite → all 4 orientations via H/V/180 | core |
| `road_straight` | 2 opposite | 1 sprite → both diagonals via flip | core |
| `road_curve_ud` | 2 adjacent (opens up/down) | 1 → 2 via V-flip | core |
| `road_curve_lr` | 2 adjacent (opens left/right) | 1 → 2 via H-flip | core |
| `road_deadend` | 1-way (stub) | 1 → 4 via flips | safety |
| *(isolated)* | none (0-way) | symmetric | optional — reuse `road_cross` or skip |

**Two curve sprites, not one,** because flips can't perform the 90° rotation that
would turn an "opens-up" bend into an "opens-right" bend — the iso projection
costs exactly one extra curve versus a rotatable top-down set. In practice the
hug-ring + connector generator emits only **≥2-connection** tiles, so
`road_deadend` and the isolated tile essentially never occur; ship `road_deadend`
as a cheap renderer fallback and skip the isolated tile.

**Required code — the autotiling resolver (✅ done 2026-06-12).** For each road
tile the renderer computes its **4 orthogonal road-neighbour mask** and maps it
to a `(sprite, transform)` pair, `transform ∈ {none, flipH, flipV, flip180}` —
the road analogue of the building **Sprite facing** flip (§7). Implemented as
the pure function `roadSpriteFor` in
[road_sprites.dart](lib/domain/city/road_sprites.dart) (all 16 masks covered by
a flip-algebra round-trip test in `test/domain/city/road_sprites_test.dart`);
the board renders the resolved sprite with canvas mirroring in
[city_board_component.dart](lib/game/city/city_board_component.dart)
(`_drawRoadTile`), drawn after the terrain pass so the overscan rim isn't
clipped by later grass diamonds.

**Art conventions** (shared with building sprites, §5.1): 2:1 dimetric, **192 px**
authoring tile, anchored to the NB road look, **no text**.
Road-specific: the asphalt must **exit each connected diamond edge exactly at its
midpoint** so neighbouring tiles join seamlessly; per the §5.1 10 m/tile scale a
road is **6 m roadway + 2 m sidewalk each side** (= one tile wide). Each road tile
is a **flat 1×1 ground tile** that *replaces* the terrain diamond — not an
extruded object.

**Resolution — generation method (2026-06-12): build-time compositor, geometry
from code + surface from NB.** Two generation methods were tried and rejected
first-hand: (a) "one NB prompt emits the whole sheet" — tiles came out
inconsistent and edges didn't meet at the diamond-edge midpoints, breaking
seamless tiling; (b) pure procedural fills — flat color next to painterly NB
buildings reads as cardboard (same failure as the Phase-7 placeholders). The
shipped pipeline splits the difference:
[compose_roads.py](tools/sprite_pipeline/compose_roads.py) renders each tile's
**geometry analytically** (signed-distance fields in top-down meter space,
inverse-projected per pixel, 4× supersampled — so edge-midpoint crossings,
6 m + 2 m + 2 m widths, curve radii, and tile-periodic dash spacing are exact by
construction) and fills it with **textures quilted out of a single NB-generated
reference tile**,
[raw_sheets/road_style_ref.jpeg](tools/sprite_pipeline/raw_sheets/road_style_ref.jpeg)
(asphalt + sidewalk blocks mean-normalized and re-blended; yellow dash color,
slab-joint and curb styling matched to the same ref). Output: the 6 sprites as
final `assets/buildings/road_<shape>.png` on a 200×100 canvas — a 192×96
diamond plus a **0.4 m overscan rim** so adjacent road tiles overlap a hair
instead of showing grass through AA-thinned shared edges (road tiles therefore
draw after the full terrain pass). No `process.py` involvement — the compositor
emits game-ready PNGs directly, so the slice-step + 1×1-flat-tile-path ideas
from the 2026-06-11 draft are moot. Re-rolling the look = drop in a new
`road_style_ref.jpeg`, re-run the script. This is the *one sanctioned
exception* to §5.1's "no procedural building art" rule — road tiles are flat
geometric ground, not buildings, and the surface pixels are still NB's.

## 6. Implementation status

<!-- IMPL_STATUS_BEGIN (auto-generated by tools/city_builder/sync_implementation_status.py) -->
- **Implementation status (auto-updated 2026-06-21):**
  - §3 buildings: **55 / 55 wired** — see ✅ marks in §3.1–§3.4. Source of truth: [building_registry.dart](lib/domain/city/building_registry.dart).
  - §4 beats: **72 / 74 wired** — see ✅ marks in §4.x. Source of truth: [beat_registry.dart](lib/domain/city/beat_registry.dart).
  - Sprite art: **55 / 55 wired buildings have processed art** in [assets/buildings/](assets/buildings/). Still on the box placeholder: (none).
  - To refresh these counts and the per-row ✅ marks, run `python3 tools/city_builder/sync_implementation_status.py`.
<!-- IMPL_STATUS_END -->

✅ markers per §3 building and §4 beat are **auto-managed by**
[tools/city_builder/sync_implementation_status.py](tools/city_builder/sync_implementation_status.py)
(mirroring [tools/curriculum/sync_implementation_status.py](tools/curriculum/sync_implementation_status.py)),
syncing against `building_registry.dart` / `beat_registry.dart` /
`assets/buildings/`. Run it after any registry or sprite change; the rollup
below and the per-row marks refresh idempotently.

## 7. Open questions

**Resolved during Phase 8 drafting (2026-05-31):**
- **Education category** → moved to `services` (`school` + `high_school`). Phase 9
  applies the one-field category change to the existing `school` row.
- **Water** → a **hard-gating** service (`water` joins `gatingServiceIds`), arc
  `water_tower` → `water_treatment`.
- **Housing depth** → keep all **7 rungs**; tune pacing by playtest.
- **Capstone gating** → capstones gate on **lifetime coins** (1–4 h of total
  study, re-denominated 2026-09-08) so they read as "you've practiced a lot"
  trophies. Applied in §3; confirm feel in playtest.

**Resolved 2026-06-04 (art-pipeline session):**
- **Sprite facing** → one sprite per building variant, all generated in the
  same south-west-facing convention Nano Banana produces by default (entrance
  on the bottom-left face). The renderer **flips horizontally per placement**
  when that orientation would point the building's front toward the nearest
  adjacent road. **No 4-facing rotation system** — mobile-iso convention is
  fixed camera + at most 2 effective facings; 4× generation cost not justified
  for a kids math game. The §5.1 "No text on any sprite" hard rule is the
  corollary that makes horizontal mirroring legal (mirrored text reads
  backwards). Phase 9 adds (a) a `BuildingPlacement.flipped: bool` column
  (additive, default `false` — no schema-wipe needed), (b) a flip-decision step
  in `road_network.dart` that walks each placed building and picks the
  orientation whose south-west face touches the most adjacent road tiles, and
  (c) a `flipHorizontally: bool` parameter on the sprite-draw call in the Flame
  city renderer.
- **No camera rotation in v1** → fixed isometric camera angle, no
  clockwise/counter-clockwise rotation control. Mobile-iso convention; players
  adapt in seconds; would gate on the 4-facing system above. Forward-compatible
  if added in a later phase — `BuildingPlacement.flipped` extends cleanly to a
  `facing: enum` if the decision is ever revisited.

**Still open (need Phase-9 implementation or playtest):**
- **Multi-tile footprints (up to `6×6`).** Every Phase-7 building is `1×1`; this
  catalog uses footprints from `1×1` to `6×6`, including rectangular ones (`3×1`,
  `4×2`, `4×3`). The placement invariant in
  [placement_rules.dart](lib/domain/city/placement_rules.dart) already walks the
  real footprint ring, but the **renderer, tap-to-place hit-testing, and road
  generation** need verification/work for multi-tile (and non-square) buildings
  before these can ship. First Phase-9 task on the art/placement track.
- **Starting map size & land expansion.** The beginner map is `12×12`
  ([city_map_registry.dart](lib/domain/city/city_map_registry.dart)). With the
  realistic footprints above, that fills up by mid-game and *cannot* hold the
  late/capstone builds (a `6×6` amusement park is a quarter of it). Phase 9's
  **land expansion** is therefore a prerequisite for the late game, not optional
  polish — and the beginner map may want a modest bump. The big capstone unlock
  rules (`pop≥100`+, `life🪙≥10800`+) already pace these well past the point where a
  player would have expanded. Confirm the starting size + expansion cadence in
  Phase 9.
- **`TriggerRule` extension for ratio warnings.** `warn_lopsided` and
  `warn_growth_stalled` (§4.3) can't be expressed with the current
  buildingsPresent/absent/pop/age/beats/coins fields — they need the growth
  model to surface a `lopsided` boolean and a `growthStalled` boolean into
  `TriggerContext`. Small, additive; the only mechanic touch Phase 9 needs beyond
  content. Everything else in this doc fits the existing typed rules.
- **Flavor-variant beats.** §4.5's path to "hundreds of beats" is multiple
  interchangeable texts per trigger, chosen at random. Confirm the
  `StoryBeat`/registry shape wants a `List<String>` of longTexts vs. separate beat
  rows — a Phase-9 authoring-ergonomics call.
- **Service-ratio & cost tuning.** All §3 numbers are designed-coherent
  placeholders; final values come from Phase-9 playtest (per plan.md's standing
  Phase-9 open question on residents-per-service and variety curves).
- **Per-tier upgrades vs. distinct types.** This design models progression as
  *distinct building types* in an arc (place a new high-rise next to the old
  apartment). Phase 9 also lists "building upgrade tiers" (upgrade-in-place, up to
  3 visual tiers). Decide per arc which rungs are new-type vs. in-place upgrades;
  the `maxTier` / `assetRefByTier` fields in the Data Model already anticipate the
  in-place path.
