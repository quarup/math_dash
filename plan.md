## Status

- **Phase:** Phase 3 complete. Ready for Phase 4.
- **Last updated:** 2026-05-03
- **Last action:** Refactored Phase 4+ roadmap and PRD cosmetics design. The old "Stars, Milestones, Shop" phase splits into: Phase 4 (persistent stars + avatar accessories via off-the-shelf library), Phase 5 (city-builder foundations), Phase 6 (city-builder depth). Milestone-threshold system dropped — replaced by per-item star prices and total-stars-earned unlocks. Phase 3's CustomPainter avatar will be replaced by an off-the-shelf library (DiceBear / Multiavatar / avatar_maker — picked in Phase 4 spike).
- **Next action:** Phase 4, step 1 — spike: evaluate DiceBear, Multiavatar, and avatar_maker for full-body avatar with multi-slot accessory support; pick one.
- **Deferred:** Audio SFX + background music (CC0 assets not sourced yet — stub in place). iOS verification. Both revisit before Phase 9 at latest.

## Locked Decisions

| Area | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Framework** | Flutter (stable channel) + [Flame](https://flame-engine.org/) game engine | Single codebase for iOS+Android; Flame actively maintained in 2026 (Flame Game Jam 2026 ran in March); BSD-licensed; provides sprite/animation/gesture primitives we need for the spin wheel and avatar |
| **Language** | Dart 3.x | Required by Flutter |
| **State management** | [Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev/) 3.x | Recommended default for new Flutter projects in 2026; compile-time safety, low boilerplate, great testability |
| **Local persistence** | [Drift](https://pub.dev/packages/drift) (SQLite + compile-time-safe queries) | Best-supported in 2026 (Hive and Isar are now community-maintained after author stepped away); SQL is great for filtering questions by concept+difficulty band; predictable migrations |
| **Audio** | [`flame_audio`](https://pub.dev/packages/flame_audio) (wrapper over `audioplayers`) | Natural fit with Flame; supports SFX pools and background music |
| **Cloud save** | [`games_services`](https://pub.dev/packages/games_services) package — Google Play Games (Android) + Game Center / iCloud (iOS) | Only solution that satisfies the PRD's "no custom server" requirement on both platforms with a single API. Last updated Dec 2025 |
| **Concept granularity** | Track proficiency at **sub-concept** level (e.g. "2-digit addition with carry"), not at category level. Roll up to category for display only | Otherwise the adaptive wheel is too coarse: a kid who's mastered single-digit addition would falsely look ready for multi-digit. See PRD's Concept System section for the category→concept taxonomy |
| **Cosmetics economy** | Two sinks for stars: (a) avatar accessories, (b) city builder. Player chooses how to balance | Two distinct goal types — short-term ("buy a hat now") and long-arc ("grow my city over months") — keeps motivation varied for kids |
| **Avatar rendering** | Off-the-shelf library (DiceBear / Multiavatar / avatar_maker — final pick in Phase 4 spike). Replaces Phase 3 CustomPainter | Libraries provide rich accessory variety for free; Phase 3 painter was always a placeholder ("avatar art source TBD") |
| **City rendering** | Isometric tiles, fixed grid, **auto-generated roads** between buildings | Mobile-friendly: tile-snap + auto-roads avoid fiddly placement; established CC0 isometric packs (e.g. Kenney City Kit) cover the style |
| **Milestones** | **Removed.** Replaced by per-item star prices and total-stars-earned thresholds for unlocking new building types and themed maps | Milestones were dead weight once the city builder provides natural long-arc progression — every land expansion or new building tier *is* a milestone moment |
| **Repo plan doc** | `plan.md` at repo root | Simple, greppable, lives next to `prd.md` |
| **AI agent doc** | `CLAUDE.md` at repo root | Emerging convention; auto-loaded by Claude Code each session |

## Architecture Overview

Four layers, top to bottom:

1. **Presentation (Flutter widgets)** — screens, navigation, forms (player creation, shop, progress screen, settings).
2. **Game (Flame components)** — spin wheel, avatar render, question presentation, animations, audio cues.
3. **Domain (pure Dart)** — game rules: concept-band classification, proficiency updates, wheel selection logic, milestone unlocks, star math. **No Flutter or Flame imports here** — keeps it unit-testable and portable.
4. **Data (Drift + cloud-save)** — local SQLite for player profiles, proficiency records, owned items; question catalog as a read-only seeded table; cloud-save bridge for backup/restore.

State management (Riverpod) sits at the boundary between presentation and domain — providers expose domain objects to widgets reactively.

## Data Model (sketch — refined per phase as we go)

```
Player
  id, name, gradeLevel, createdAt
  avatarConfig          // library-specific avatar parameters (replaces Phase 3 chibi config in Phase 4)
  currentStars          // spendable balance
  lifetimeStarsEarned   // never decreases — drives progressive unlocks
  currentStreak, lastPlayedDate

ConceptProficiency
  playerId, conceptId, proficiency (0.0–1.0), lastUpdatedAt
  questionsAnswered, questionsCorrect

Concept (static catalog) — sub-concept granularity (e.g. "2-digit addition with carry")
  id, name, categoryId, gradeRange, description

ConceptCategory (static catalog) — display grouping only (e.g. "Addition & subtraction")
  id, name, displayOrder

Question (static catalog for non-arithmetic concepts; arithmetic generated at runtime)
  id, conceptId, difficultyBand (comfortable | challenging),
  prompt (text or template), correctAnswer,
  distractors (for multiple-choice), explanation (for wrong-answer screen)
  source (algorithmic | curated | ai_generated), license

// --- Avatar accessories (Phase 4) ---

AvatarAccessory (static catalog)
  id, slot (hat | glasses | costume | shoes | backpack | cape | prop | facePaint),
  name, starCost,
  libraryRef            // parameters for the chosen avatar library

OwnedAccessory
  playerId, accessoryId, equipped (bool)

// --- City builder (Phase 5+) ---

City (per player, per map)
  id, playerId, mapId,
  gridWidth, gridHeight,         // grows on land expansion (Phase 6)
  population

CityMap (static catalog)
  id, name, theme (countryside | city | futuristic | …),
  baseGridWidth, baseGridHeight,
  starCostToUnlock (0 for the beginner map),
  terrainSeed                    // deterministic terrain layout

BuildingType (static catalog)
  id, name, category (residential | services | utilities | commercial),
  starCost,
  unlockedAtLifetimeStars,
  populationContribution,         // residents this building can house, if any
  serviceProvision,               // map of {school: N, hospital: N, power: N, …}
  maxTier, assetRefByTier

BuildingPlacement
  id, cityId, buildingTypeId, currentTier, gridX, gridY, placedAt

GameSession (in-memory only)
  startedAt, players (list), roundsPlayed
  // Streak lives on Player, not here
```

**Notes:**
- `Item` and `Milestone` from earlier sketches are removed. The cosmetics system splits into `AvatarAccessory` and city tables.
- `currentStars` vs. `lifetimeStarsEarned`: spending stars decreases `currentStars`; both correct *and* spent stars count toward `lifetimeStarsEarned` for unlock gating (so spending doesn't lock players out of progression).
- `serviceProvision` lets the city growth model use simple aggregate ratios (e.g. "1 school per 50 residents") rather than per-building dependency graphs.

## Domain Specs (set during Phase 0)

### Initial concept scope for Phase 1

Phase 1 ships **two concepts**, both pure single-digit arithmetic:

| Concept ID | Description | Operand range | Result range |
|---|---|---|---|
| `add_1digit` | Single-digit addition | a, b ∈ [0, 9] | sum ∈ [0, 18] |
| `sub_1digit` | Single-digit subtraction (no negatives) | minuend ∈ [0, 18], subtrahend ∈ [0, 9], a ≥ b | diff ∈ [0, 18] |

Both are algorithmically generated at runtime (no curated dataset needed). Distractors for multiple-choice are constructed from common mistakes: off-by-one (±1), swapped operands, and a randomly-chosen value within ±5 of the correct answer.

Why these two: universally familiar across the entire 6–14 target age, trivially generatable, and two-concepts-on-the-wheel is enough to make the spin feel like a real choice without needing the full catalog.

### Phase 2 concepts

| Concept ID | Description | Operand range | Result range | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `mul_1digit` | Single-digit multiplication | a, b ∈ [1, 9] | product ∈ [1, 81] | Skip ×0 and ×1 as trivial |
| `div_1digit` | Single-digit division (exact) | divisor ∈ [2, 9], quotient ∈ [1, 9] | quotient ∈ [1, 9] | Generated as quotient×divisor=dividend; no remainders |
| `add_2digit` | 2-digit addition | a, b ∈ [10, 99] | sum ∈ [20, 198] | |
| `sub_2digit` | 2-digit subtraction (no negatives) | minuend ∈ [10, 99], subtrahend ∈ [10, 99], a ≥ b | diff ∈ [0, 89] | |

All four are algorithmically generated at runtime. Distractors use the same strategy as Phase 1 (off-by-one, operand swap, random ±5).

Fractions, geometry, and word problems are deferred to Phase 6.

### Proficiency update formula (sketch — refine in Phase 2)

Proficiency `p` per (player, concept) lives in [0.0, 1.0]. After each answer:

```
p_new = clamp(p_old + α · (target - p_old), 0.0, 1.0)
```

where `target = 1.0` on correct, `target = 0.0` on wrong, and `α` is a learning rate. Proposed initial `α = 0.1`.

Properties of this update:
- Stable: one wrong answer can't tank a player's score
- Asymptotic toward target — quick at first, slows near 0 or 1
- O(1), no history needed
- Easy to unit-test (deterministic, monotonic)

**Band thresholds (initial, tunable in Phase 2):**

| p range | Band | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `p < 0.2` | not yet | Excluded from wheel |
| `0.2 ≤ p < 0.5` | challenging | On wheel; correct = 5 stars; multiple choice |
| `0.5 ≤ p < 0.85` | comfortable | On wheel; correct = 3 stars; typed input |
| `p ≥ 0.85` | mastered | Excluded from wheel |

**Initial value** when a player first encounters a concept:
- Concept grade ≤ player's stated grade: start at `p = 0.4` (challenging band)
- Concept grade > player's stated grade: start at `p = 0.05` (not yet, off the wheel)

Open Phase 2 knobs: tune `α`, asymmetric reward/penalty (e.g. wrong answers move p down faster than right answers move it up), threshold values, and whether to consider time-since-last-attempt (proficiency decays if not practiced).

## Phase Roadmap

Each phase ends with something demonstrable. We do **not** start a phase until the previous one is "done enough" to ship internally.

### Phase 0 — Foundation (complete)
- [x] Flutter SDK installed (3.41.7); `flutter create` scaffold for iOS+Android with org `com.quarup`
- [x] Locked dependencies installed: `flame`, `flutter_riverpod`, `riverpod_annotation`, `drift`, `sqlite3_flutter_libs`, `path_provider`, `path`, `flame_audio`, `games_services`; dev deps `build_runner`, `drift_dev`, `very_good_analysis`. Skipped `riverpod_generator` + `riverpod_lint` + `custom_lint` due to a Riverpod-3 / analyzer incompatibility — revisit when ecosystem catches up
- [x] Linting (`very_good_analysis`); `dart format` clean
- [x] GitHub Actions CI: format check + analyze + test on push/PR (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- [x] Initial concept scope for Phase 1 decided — see *Domain Specs* above
- [x] Proficiency-update math sketched — see *Domain Specs* above
- [x] **Exit criteria (Path B — Android only):** `flutter run` launched the placeholder Math Dash app on the Android emulator (Pixel 7, API 34) successfully. iOS verification deferred to Phase 7
- [ ] iOS exit criteria — deferred until Xcode is installed (no later than Phase 7)

### Phase 1 — Vertical Slice (target: ~2–3 weeks) [the most important phase]
**Goal: prove the core loop is fun.** Hardcoded single player, two concepts, no persistence beyond runtime. Concepts and proficiency math are specified in *Domain Specs* above.
- [x] Concept registry with the two Phase 1 concepts (`add_1digit`, `sub_1digit`)
- [x] Algorithmic question generator with operand ranges per spec; distractor strategy per spec
- [x] `SpinWheel` Flame component (4 segments, tap-to-spin animation, lands on a concept)
- [x] `QuestionScreen` with 4-option multiple choice
- [x] `ResultScreen` with star award + wrong-answer explanation
- [x] Loop: home → spin → question → result → home, with star counter persisted in memory
- [ ] Basic SFX (spin, correct, wrong) and one looping background track — deferred to Phase 6 (CC0 assets not sourced; stub in place)
- [x] **Exit criteria:** Test with a real kid in the target age range — passed.

### Phase 2 — Adaptive Concept System (target: ~2–3 weeks)

**Design decisions (locked):**
- **Player:** A single default player is seeded into Drift on first launch. Full player creation / profile picker is Phase 3.
- **Numeric input UX:** Comfortable-band questions use an on-screen number pad (calculator-style) with an explicit submit button. Device keyboard not used. Text-answer question types deferred.
- **Concept expansion:** Only algorithmically generatable concepts added this phase (see *Domain Specs — Phase 2 concepts* below). Fractions, geometry, and word problems deferred to Phase 6.

- [x] Drift schema for `Player` and `ConceptProficiency`; seed default player on first launch
- [x] Proficiency update logic (correct → up, wrong → down with floor); unit tests
- [x] Band classifier (mastered / comfortable / challenging / not yet) with grade-aware thresholds
- [x] Wheel selection: weighted sample of comfortable + challenging bands only
- [x] Number-pad input mode for comfortable-band concepts (on-screen pad + submit button)
- [x] Add 4 new concepts: `mul_1digit`, `div_1digit`, `add_2digit`, `sub_2digit` (all algorithmic)
- [ ] **Exit criteria:** A returning player sees the wheel adapt — easy concepts disappear, harder ones appear, number-pad input shows up for concepts they've practiced

### Phase 3 — Player Profiles & Avatar (complete)
- [x] Player creation flow (name, grade, basic avatar)
- [x] Profile picker on app launch
- [x] Mid-session player switching at start of each round (SpinScreen AppBar)
- [x] CustomPainter chibi avatar (slots: skin tone, hair, eyes, shirt, pants — drawn in Flutter, no external assets)
- [x] **Exit criteria:** Two kids can share the device with separate stats and avatars

**Open question resolved:** Avatar art sourced as pure Flutter CustomPainter (no external sprites). Simple geometric "chibi" style — works at all sizes, zero asset licensing burden.

### Phase 4 — Persistent Stars + Avatar Accessories (target: ~2–3 weeks)

**Goal:** Stars persist across app restarts. Player can spend them on visible avatar accessories.

- [ ] **Spike (first day or two):** Build throwaway prototypes of DiceBear, Multiavatar, and `avatar_maker` with the same target outfit (skin + hair + hat + glasses + costume). Pick one based on: full-body coverage, slot variety, license, render perf on Android emulator. Document the choice in *Locked Decisions*.
- [ ] Drift schema migration (v3): split `totalStars` into `currentStars` + `lifetimeStarsEarned`; add `OwnedAccessory` table; replace `avatarConfig` shape with library-specific parameters
- [ ] Replace Phase 3 CustomPainter avatar with the chosen library (delete `lib/game/avatar/` chibi painter once new path is wired)
- [ ] `AvatarAccessory` static catalog seeded from JSON: ~5 items per slot for v1 (hat, glasses, costume, shoes, backpack — propsl/cape/face paint can wait)
- [ ] Star-award flow writes through to Drift on each round (no more in-memory star total)
- [ ] Shop screen: browse all accessories, filter to affordable, "buy" (debits `currentStars`), "equip"/"unequip"
- [ ] Live avatar preview while browsing the shop
- [ ] Avatar (with equipped accessories) visible on home screen, spin screen, and result screen
- [ ] **Exit criteria:** Kid plays a round, earns stars, opens the shop, buys a hat, equips it, returns to the spin screen and sees the hat on their avatar. Closes app, reopens — stars and equipped hat are still there.

**Open questions for Phase 4:**
- Which library? (Spike output)
- If the chosen library doesn't cover all 8 slots, do we drop the missing slots from v1 or augment with sprite overlays? Decide after spike.

---

### Phase 5 — City Builder: Foundations (target: ~3–4 weeks)

**Goal:** Each player has their own persistent isometric city. They spend stars to place buildings; population grows when the right mix is built.

- [ ] Source/curate isometric building art (start: Kenney City Kit Industrial; supplement if needed). Confirm CC0 status, log in eventual `LICENSES_THIRD_PARTY.md`
- [ ] Drift schema (v4): `City`, `CityMap`, `BuildingType`, `BuildingPlacement` tables
- [ ] One beginner `CityMap` definition: ~10×10 tile grid, fixed terrain (grass + decorative water/stone)
- [ ] Initial `BuildingType` catalog (5 types): own house, apartment, school, hospital, power plant
- [ ] Isometric tile renderer (Flame component) — render terrain + placed buildings, support pinch-zoom and pan
- [ ] Build-mode UI: building catalog at the bottom, tap building → tap free tile → placed; insufficient stars greys out the option
- [ ] Move-mode UI: pick up an existing building, tap a new free tile to drop it (no star cost)
- [ ] Auto-road generation: roads automatically connect every placed building (recompute on placement / move). Render under buildings on the road tiles
- [ ] Population counter clearly visible on the city screen
- [ ] Population growth model (pure-Dart, well unit-tested): population grows toward `sum(populationContribution)` capped by service ratios (e.g. 1 school per 50 residents, 1 hospital per 100, 1 power plant per 200). Below the lowest-satisfied ratio, growth stalls
- [ ] One feedback message when stalled (cycle through if multiple constraints fail): "Your residents need a school to keep growing"
- [ ] "My City" screen accessible from the home screen
- [ ] **Exit criteria:** Player places 5 buildings, sees population grow, hits a service-ratio cap, reads the feedback message, builds the missing service, sees population resume growth — all surviving an app restart

---

### Phase 6 — City Builder: Depth (target: ~2–3 weeks)

**Goal:** City has long-arc progression — bigger land, more building types, themed maps, events.

- [ ] Land expansion: spend stars to grow the grid symmetrically outward by 2 tiles per side. Cap at, say, 20×20 for v1
- [ ] Progressive `BuildingType` unlocks gated by `lifetimeStarsEarned` (e.g. coffee shop at 200, gas station at 400, hotel at 800)
- [ ] Expand catalog to ~12–15 building types (add: coffee shop, restaurant, gas station, hotel, waste management, office, fire station — final list set during the phase)
- [ ] Building upgrade tiers: each `BuildingType` has up to 3 tiers; upgrading costs stars; **footprint stays the same**, only the texture/style changes
- [ ] Additional `CityMap`s with themes (countryside, big-city, futuristic) — each has its own `starCostToUnlock` and its own independent placement state per player
- [ ] Map switcher UI on the city screen
- [ ] Star-funded events: "Festival" (+population for X rounds), "Marketing campaign" (boosts attractiveness), 2–3 event types
- [ ] Aggregate-needs system extended: parameterize service ratios from `serviceProvision` data, so adding a new building type is data-only
- [ ] **Exit criteria:** A returning player has unlocked at least one new building type via lifetime stars, expanded their land once, switched between two map themes, and run an event

---

### Phase 7 — Player Progress Screen (target: ~1 week)
- [ ] Concept proficiency visualization (radar chart or color grid) — rolled up to category
- [ ] Strengths and growing edges sections with positive framing
- [ ] Lifetime stats: stars earned, sessions, questions answered
- [ ] **Exit criteria:** Player can see and feel proud of their own progress

---

### Phase 8 — Sound, Polish, Engagement (target: ~2–3 weeks)
- [ ] Final SFX library (CC0/royalty-free); per-event audio (spin, correct, wrong, building-placed, level-up)
- [ ] Background music (looping, with mute toggle)
- [ ] Animation polish (character reactions on correct/wrong; screen transitions)
- [ ] Daily streak tracking + bonus stars
- [ ] Daily challenge mechanic
- [ ] First-launch tutorial (skippable)
- [ ] Settings screen (audio mute, reset profile, change grade level, dyslexia-friendly font toggle if time)
- [ ] **Extra credit — animated city** (drop if time runs short, defer to post-launch):
  - [ ] Cars driving along the auto-roads
  - [ ] Pedestrians on sidewalks
  - [ ] Building lights turning on/off
  - [ ] Day/night cycle on the city screen
- [ ] **Exit criteria:** It feels like a real game, not a prototype

---

### Phase 9 — Cloud Save (target: ~1–2 weeks)
- [ ] Integrate `games_services` save game API
- [ ] Sign-in flow (Game Center / Play Games) — graceful skip if signed out
- [ ] Save-on-meaningful-event (round end, accessory purchase, building placed, map unlocked)
- [ ] Load on app start; conflict resolution (prefer most recent)
- [ ] iOS verification (deferred from Phase 0 — `flutter run` on iOS simulator must succeed before this phase ships)
- [ ] **Exit criteria:** Install on a second device, sign in, see same player data including avatar, stars, and city state

---

### Phase 10 — Beta + Store Submission (ongoing)
- [ ] **Apple Developer Program** enrollment ($99/yr) — only when ready to submit; not blocking earlier work
- [ ] **Google Play Console** enrollment ($25 one-time)
- [ ] App Store Connect: register bundle ID, fill listing metadata, age rating questionnaire, kids-category settings ("Made for Kids")
- [ ] Play Console: register the app, fill listing metadata, "Designed for Families" enrollment, target-audience declaration
- [ ] Build artifacts: signed Android AAB; signed iOS archive (requires macOS + Xcode)
- [ ] App icon, screenshots (Android + iOS at multiple sizes), feature graphic, store description copy
- [ ] Privacy policy (minimal — we collect ~nothing — but COPPA-aware language; either template-based or briefly legal-reviewed)
- [ ] TestFlight (iOS) internal testing
- [ ] Play Console internal-testing channel
- [ ] Iterate on real beta feedback (1–2 cycles)
- [ ] Submit to stores; respond to reviewer feedback
- [ ] **Exit criteria:** App is live on both stores

---

## Open Questions / Decisions Deferred

These are not blockers for Phase 0 or 1 but need to be resolved by the phase noted:

- **By Phase 2 (resolved):** Proficiency update formula — using simple exponential moving average; see *Domain Specs*.
- **By Phase 2:** Question dataset sourcing strategy for non-arithmetic concepts — curate from [GSM8K](https://github.com/openai/grade-school-math) (MIT license) and [MathDataset-ElementarySchool](https://github.com/RamonKaspar/MathDataset-ElementarySchool), or generate via batch LLM? Probably both — start with curation. Defer to Phase 6+ when fractions/word problems are added.
- **By Phase 4:** **Avatar library pick** — DiceBear (which styles? does any one style cover all our slots?), Multiavatar, or `avatar_maker`? First action of Phase 4 is the spike that answers this.
- **By Phase 4 (after spike):** If chosen library doesn't cover all 8 accessory slots, drop missing slots from v1 *or* layer sprite overlays from a CC0 pack. Decide based on spike.
- **By Phase 5:** Specific isometric-asset packs — Kenney's [City Kit Industrial](https://kenney.nl/assets/city-kit-industrial) is a strong starting point but coverage is limited. Identify supplementary packs (Kenney's other city packs, [OpenGameArt isometric tag](https://opengameart.org/art-search-advanced?keys=isometric)) before catalog work begins.
- **By Phase 6:** Specific list of building types and their service-ratio numbers (residents-per-school, etc.) — can only be tuned by play-testing.
- **By Phase 8:** Music + SFX sourcing (CC0 from Freesound.org and OpenGameArt.org).
- **By Phase 9:** Are we OK requiring the user to sign in to Game Center / Play Games for cloud save? Otherwise local-only is the only option.
- **By Phase 10:** Privacy policy text — minimal since we collect ~nothing, but COPPA considerations for under-13 audience need legal review or a template.

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Core loop isn't fun for kids | Medium | Critical | Phase 1 explicitly tested this with a real kid before any further investment — passed |
| Question dataset gap | Medium | High | Algorithmic generation handles arithmetic; for everything else, multiple datasets identified (GSM8K, MathDataset-ElementarySchool, Illustrative Mathematics) |
| Avatar library doesn't cover all 8 slots | Medium | Medium | Spike at start of Phase 4 evaluates 3 candidates; fallback is to drop sparse slots from v1 or layer sprite overlays |
| City UX on small screens (placement, panning, zoom on a phone) | Medium | High | Auto-roads (no precision needed); tile-snap with generous tap targets; pinch-zoom + pan; play-test on smallest target device early in Phase 5 |
| Isometric asset coverage gap | Medium | Medium | Kenney's City Kit packs are the starting point but limited; identify 1–2 supplementary CC0 packs in early Phase 5. If coverage is still sparse, narrow the v1 building catalog rather than ship inconsistent art |
| Population growth model feels arbitrary or unmotivating | Medium | Medium | Keep model simple (aggregate ratios, not per-building dependency graphs); tune via play-testing. Vague-but-themed feedback messages keep the player oriented even if numbers shift |
| City save state migration as schema evolves across phases | Medium | Medium | Drift migrations are version-checked; player's city is purely cosmetic so a wipe is a survivable last resort. Bias toward additive schema changes |
| Cloud save platform divergence | Low (single package) | Medium | `games_services` abstracts both — but test on both platforms early in Phase 9 |
| `games_services` package abandonment | Low | Medium | If it goes stale, fall back to platform-specific packages (`cloud_kit` for iOS, `googleapis` Drive for Android) |
| Hive/Isar abandonment pattern repeats with Drift | Low | Low | Drift is built on SQLite; worst-case migration to raw `sqflite` is straightforward |
| COPPA / children's-app compliance | Medium | High (could block store submission) | No data collection; address this explicitly in Phase 10 with a minimal privacy policy and store-listing kids-category settings |
| Apple Developer Program ($99/yr) and Play Console ($25 one-time) fees | Certain | Low–Medium | Real ongoing cost for a "free hobby project." If the Apple membership lapses, the iOS build is delisted from the App Store. Budget accordingly; consider whether one platform-only launch buys more time |
| Sub-concept catalog explosion | Medium | Medium | The category→concept taxonomy in PRD lists ~40+ concepts already; full K–8 could push past 100. Mitigate by defining only what's needed per phase (Phase 1: 2 concepts; Phase 2: ~10; Phase 8+: full) and keeping the schema flexible |

## How We Work (AI-Assisted Conventions)

Since this is a two-person project (you + Claude), some norms to keep us efficient:

- **PRD is product scope, plan.md is execution.** Don't conflate. If product scope changes, update [prd.md](prd.md). If execution approach changes, update this file.
- **Update `Status` section** at the top of this file at the end of each work session — current phase, last action, next action. Keeps the next session cold-startable.
- **Check off phase task boxes as we go** so we always know where we are.
- **Open questions go in the "Open Questions" section above** — don't let them get buried in chat. When answered, move the answer into the relevant phase or "Locked Decisions."
- **Risks: revisit at start of each phase** — drop ones that no longer apply, add new ones surfaced by the work.
- **Code style:** see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for conventions, build/test commands, and architecture notes the AI should follow.
