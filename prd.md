# Math Dash — Product Requirements Document

**Math Dash** is a mobile game for Android and iOS that makes math practice fun for kids. Multiple players can share a single device, each with their own profile and progress.

**Target audience:** Kids ages 6–14, with math content spanning grades K–8.

**Platform:** Cross-platform mobile (iOS + Android), built with Flutter and the Flame game engine.

**Business model:** Completely free — no ads, no in-app purchases, no subscriptions. All content, assets, and libraries used must be compatible with free, non-commercial educational use (open licenses preferred).

**Compliance:** Designed for ages 6–14, the app must satisfy children's-app requirements on both stores: no third-party tracking, no data collection beyond local profiles, no behavioral advertising. Privacy policy required. Apple "Made for Kids" and Google "Designed for Families" guidelines apply.

**Accessibility:** Baseline a11y is in scope from the start — color-blind-safe palette (the wheel relies heavily on color, so segments must also be distinguishable by shape/icon), readable type at small sizes, audio cues for key feedback (so a 6-year-old who isn't yet reading fluently can play), respect for OS-level text-size settings. Optional dyslexia-friendly font (e.g. OpenDyslexic) toggle is a stretch goal for Phase 6.

**Localization:** v1 ships English-only. All user-facing strings must be externalized (no hardcoded text in widgets) so future translation is mechanical, not a rewrite.

## Success Metrics

These focus on learning outcomes, not time-on-app:

- **Concept progression:** % of players who advance at least one concept from "challenging" to "comfortable" within their first 5 sessions
- **Accuracy improvement:** wrong-answer rate per concept decreases over successive attempts (player is actually learning, not just guessing)
- **Breadth of practice:** average number of distinct concept categories practiced per week (kids are exploring, not grinding one concept)
- **Challenge engagement:** % of correct answers that are 5-star (challenging-band) questions — higher = player is being appropriately stretched
- **Retention through learning:** D14 retention among players who advanced at least one concept level (learning = reason to return)

---

## Player Creation & Profile

When the app opens, the player selects their profile or creates a new one.

**Creating a new player:**
- Enter a name
- Select starting school grade (K–8)
- Customize basic appearance: skin tone, hair style/color, eye color, basic clothing. [Simple 2D avatar — no 3D required initially]

**Advanced customization** (hats, accessories, special clothing, gadgets, pets, vehicles) must be **earned** via points ("stars") — see *Redeeming Stars* section.

Multiple player profiles can exist on one device with no login required. [Assumption: no account/auth on first version; cloud save is opt-in — see *Saving User Data*]

---

## Gameplay Loop

Each **round** follows this sequence:

1. **Player select** — The current player can hand the device to another player at the start of any round.
2. **Spin the wheel** — A colorful wheel displays 4–8 math concepts (selected from a larger pool, weighted toward concepts the player needs to practice). Player taps to spin.
3. **Answer a question** — A question in the landed concept category appears at the player's current level for that concept.
4. **Result:**
   - **Correct answer at regular difficulty:** +3 stars, celebratory animation/sound.
   - **Correct answer at challenge difficulty** (near the edge of their ability): +5 stars, bigger celebration.
   - **Wrong answer:** 0 stars. A friendly step-by-step explanation guides the player to the correct answer. No penalty — the game stays encouraging.
5. Return to step 1.

### Answer Input

Input method is tied to the player's proficiency band for that concept:

- **Challenging band** → **Multiple choice** (4 options). Distractors are plausible (e.g. off-by-one, common conceptual mistakes). Reduces friction when the concept is unfamiliar.
- **Comfortable band** → **Typed numeric answer**. No hints from distractors; tests genuine recall and reinforces fluency.

This means the same player might type answers for concepts they've mastered and pick from options for concepts they're still developing.

### Timer

No hard timer in v1. After ~20 seconds of inactivity, the character plays a gentle "thinking" animation as a nudge — but the player can take as long as they need. A timed-mode toggle is out of scope for v1 (see *Out of Scope*).

### Multiplayer Turn Structure
When multiple players share a device, they **alternate rounds** in a single session (Player A spins → Player B spins → ...). Each player's stars and concept data update independently. A per-session leaderboard shows how many stars each player earned this session.

## Concept System & Adaptive Difficulty

The game tracks proficiency at the **sub-concept** level — not at broad category level — because a kid who's mastered single-digit addition has not necessarily mastered multi-digit addition, and the wheel needs to surface the right granularity.

### Two-level taxonomy: Categories → Concepts

**Categories** are how proficiency is *displayed* to the player (and how the wheel groups options visually). **Concepts** are what proficiency is *tracked* against and what the wheel selects. One category contains many concepts.

Example category → concepts decomposition (full catalog defined in Phase 2):

| Category | Example concepts (each tracked independently) |
|---|---|
| **Number sense** | counting to 20, counting to 100, place value (tens), place value (hundreds), comparing 2-digit numbers, comparing 3-digit numbers |
| **Addition & subtraction** | single-digit addition, single-digit subtraction, 2-digit addition (no carry), 2-digit addition (with carry), 2-digit subtraction (no borrow), 2-digit subtraction (with borrow), 3-digit addition, 3-digit subtraction, mental addition |
| **Multiplication & division** | times tables 2–5, times tables 6–9, times tables 10–12, 2-digit × 1-digit, long multiplication, simple division, long division |
| **Fractions** | identifying fractions, comparing fractions (same denominator), comparing fractions (different denominators), adding fractions, multiplying fractions |
| **Decimals & percentages** | reading decimals, adding/subtracting decimals, converting fractions to decimals, finding percentages of numbers |
| **Geometry** | naming 2D shapes, naming 3D shapes, perimeter of rectangles, area of rectangles, area of triangles, angles |
| **Measurement** | reading clocks (hour), reading clocks (minute), length conversions, weight conversions, volume conversions |
| **Word problems** | single-step (addition/subtraction), single-step (multiplication/division), multi-step |
| **Algebra basics** (grades 6–8) | patterns, simple equations (one variable), evaluating expressions |

The wheel surfaces individual **concepts** (e.g. "2-digit addition with carry"), not categories. The Player Progress screen rolls concept data up to **categories** for a digestible at-a-glance view, with drill-down to see the per-concept detail.

### Adaptive Logic

Each concept has a **proficiency level** (e.g. 0.0–1.0) per player, updated after every answer:
- Correct answer → proficiency increases
- Wrong answer → proficiency decreases slightly (floor at 0)

The exact update formula is an implementation detail (TBD in Phase 2). It should produce stable behavior with small N (e.g. doesn't swing wildly after one wrong answer).

Based on proficiency, each concept is classified into one of four bands:

| Band | Condition | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Mastered** | Way above current level | Excluded from wheel (e.g. counting for a grade 5 player) |
| **Comfortable** | At or slightly above level | Included; correct = 3 stars |
| **Challenging** | Noticeably above current level | Included with lower probability; correct = 5 stars |
| **Not yet** | Far above current level | Excluded from wheel (e.g. calculus for grade 4) |

The wheel at any given round contains a **mix of comfortable + challenging** concepts so the player always has a chance to earn 5-star questions but isn't overwhelmed.

### Question Generation

Questions must feel **infinite and varied**. The strategy is hybrid, chosen per concept:

- **Pure-arithmetic concepts** (e.g. single-digit addition, times tables) → **algorithmic generation** at runtime. Random operands within the concept's defined range, with templated wording variation. Effectively infinite, no storage cost. Wrong-answer explanations are likewise templated.
- **Reasoning-heavy concepts** (e.g. multi-step word problems, geometry, fractions) → **curated + batch AI-generated**, shipped as static data. We seed from open-licensed datasets (GSM8K, MathDataset-ElementarySchool, Illustrative Mathematics) and supplement with offline batch LLM generation. Each question carries a hand-authored or AI-authored step-by-step explanation.

**Critical constraint:** No cloud LLM calls at runtime. All AI-generated content is produced offline, reviewed for quality, and shipped bundled with the app or as a periodically-updated content pack. This keeps the app free, offline-capable, and avoids per-user API costs.

## Cosmetics System

Stars are the in-game currency earned by answering correctly. Stars are spent on **cosmetic upgrades only** — no gameplay advantage is purchasable. The app is entirely free; stars cannot be purchased with real money.

There are two places to spend stars, and the player chooses how to balance between them. This is intentional: short-lived satisfaction from a new hat, plus a long-running creative project the player builds over weeks and months.

1. **Avatar accessories** — visible decoration on the player's character during gameplay
2. **City builder** — a persistent mini-city the player grows over time

### Avatar Accessories

The player's avatar is shown on the home screen, the spin screen, and the result screen. Accessories slot into specific positions on the avatar:

- Hat
- Glasses / eyewear
- Costume / clothing
- Shoes
- Backpack
- Cape
- Hand prop (e.g. wand, ball, instrument)
- Face paint

Each accessory has a fixed star cost. Buying it adds it to the player's wardrobe; equipping/unequipping is free. The avatar wears at most one item per slot.

Avatar art is generated by an off-the-shelf library (DiceBear-class) so accessories ship with the library and don't need to be hand-drawn. Specific library and final slot list are decided in Phase 4 — see [plan.md](plan.md).

### City Builder

Each player has their own persistent city, accessed from a dedicated **"My City"** screen. The city is built on an isometric tile grid and is **purely cosmetic** — it does not affect math gameplay. Its purpose is to give players a long-running creative project that visualizes how far they've come.

**Mechanics:**

- **Land:** Players start with a small fixed beginner map. They can spend stars to expand the land symmetrically outward, and to unlock additional themed maps later (e.g. countryside, big city, futuristic). Each map has its own independent placement state.
- **Buildings:** Buildings are placed on the grid by spending stars. Examples: own house, apartments, schools, hospitals, power plants, coffee shops, hotels, restaurants, gas stations, waste management. New building types unlock progressively as the player's lifetime stars earned grows.
- **Roads:** Auto-generated by the game to connect placed buildings — the player never manually draws roads. This avoids fiddly precision placement on a phone.
- **Moving buildings:** Free. Players can rearrange their city without spending more stars.
- **Selling buildings:** Not supported in v1. Simplifies the economy and avoids "I bought the wrong thing, refund me" friction.
- **Upgrade tiers:** Some buildings have visual upgrade tiers (e.g. wooden → brick → ornate). Tiers change the *style* of the building, not its footprint, to keep cities visually balanced as they grow.
- **Population:** A clearly visible counter shows the current population. Population grows when the player has built the right mix of buildings.
- **Growth requirements:** Population is gated by aggregate service ratios — e.g. one school per N residents, one hospital per N residents, sufficient power. The game surfaces vague-but-themed feedback when the city stalls: "Residents are commuting to the next city for medical care — build a hospital." There is also a population cap tied to land size.
- **Events:** Players can spend stars on temporary events (festivals, parades) that attract additional residents.

**Out of v1, nice to have later:**
- Animated city: cars driving on roads, building lights turning on at night, pedestrians on sidewalks, day/night cycle.
- Resident "mood" feedback variety beyond the basic service-ratio messages.
- Sharing screenshots of cities with friends.

(Detailed star prices, building unlock thresholds, and growth formulas are tuned in Phases 4–6 — see [plan.md](plan.md).)

## Sound & Visual Design

- Bright, playful color palette appropriate for kids
- Animated character that reacts to correct/wrong answers (jumps, cheers, looks sad)
- Sound effects for: wheel spin, correct answer, wrong answer, milestone unlock, star collection
- Background music (loopable, upbeat, with a mute toggle)
- All UI copy uses simple language appropriate for the youngest end of the target age range

---

## Engagement Mechanics

- **Daily streak:** Playing at least one round per day maintains a streak. Streak milestones award bonus stars.
- **Daily challenge:** One special concept challenge per day with a bonus star reward.
- Push notifications for streak reminders (v2, requires parental consent flow on iOS/Android).

---

## Player Progress Screen

Each player can view their own progress from their profile — the goal is to **empower the player** to understand where they shine and what they can improve, not to report to an adult.

The screen shows:
- **Concept proficiency chart** — visual breakdown of current level per concept category (e.g. a radar/spider chart or color-coded grid)
- **Strengths** — concepts currently in the "comfortable" band, highlighted positively
- **Growing edges** — concepts in the "challenging" band, framed as exciting opportunities ("You're leveling up in fractions!")
- **Stars earned** — total and recent history
- **Sessions and questions answered** — simple stats the player can feel proud of
- **Milestones reached** — visual timeline of milestone badges unlocked

No PIN, no adult-only section. The data is the player's own, presented in a way that's motivating rather than evaluative.

---

## Onboarding

First-time experience:
1. "Create your player" screen (name, grade, basic avatar)
2. Brief animated tutorial showing the spin wheel and how to answer (1–2 screens, skippable)
3. First question is intentionally easy to create an early win

---

## Saving User Data

All player data (profiles, proficiency levels, star counts, milestones, equipped items) is:

- **Stored locally** on the device with no account required for basic use.
- **Optionally backed up and restored** via the platform's own game services — Game Center (iOS, tied to the user's iCloud) and Google Play Games (Android). The user signs in with their existing Apple or Google account; the app does not run a backend or store any data on our infrastructure.

If the user is not signed in to their platform's game service, local-only storage is the fallback — the app remains fully playable, just without cross-device backup.

---

## Content & Licensing

All third-party content, assets, and libraries must be compatible with free non-commercial educational distribution:

- **Math questions:** Open educational resources (OER) preferred — Creative Commons licensed datasets, Khan Academy open content, OpenStax, or similar. AI-batch-generated content is acceptable if generated offline and does not require an ongoing paid API subscription for players.
- **Art assets:** CC0 or CC-BY licensed sprite sheets and icons, or custom-created.
- **Music & sound effects:** CC0 or royalty-free with no attribution required (e.g. OpenGameArt.org, Freesound.org with appropriate licenses).
- **Fonts:** OFL (SIL Open Font License) or equivalent.
- **Libraries/frameworks:** MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD, or similar permissive licenses.

---

## Edge Cases

- **Player masters all v1 content.** If every available concept drops into the "mastered" band, the wheel falls back to a celebration message ("You've mastered everything! New concepts coming soon.") and offers a free-play mode that randomly samples from mastered concepts (no stars awarded — keeps it from being a grind for trivial points).
- **Mid-question abandonment.** If the player closes the app or switches profiles before answering, the question is discarded with no proficiency change and no stars. It does not count as wrong.
- **Profile deletion.** Players can delete their own profile from the profile picker (with a confirmation prompt). All local data for that profile is removed; cloud-save data for that profile is also removed on next sync if signed in.
- **Two players want to play simultaneously.** Not supported — gameplay is turn-based on a single device. The "alternate rounds" structure is the v1 multiplayer model.
- **Grade-level advancement.** A player's stored grade level is the *starting point* for the adaptive system, not a moving target. The system adapts based on actual proficiency, so a player who advances grades in real life will naturally see harder concepts enter their wheel without any manual update. A "change grade" option is available in settings if a parent wants to recalibrate.

## Out of Scope (v1)

- Real-time multiplayer over the internet
- Teacher/classroom mode
- Timed quiz mode
- Leaderboards beyond the per-session summary
- Push notifications (v2)
- In-app analytics or crash reporting (revisit if needed; would require privacy disclosure)
